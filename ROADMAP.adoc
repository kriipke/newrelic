üß± Structural & YAML Refactoring

Introduce YAML anchors/templates for repeated queries (e.g., shared SLO logic across widgets).
Create reusable widget templates (e.g., billboard, table, timeseries) for DRY layouts.
Add support for multi-page dashboards in the YAML config.
Allow metadata for widget groups or sections (e.g., group: SLOs for organizing in output or docs).
Add support for external YAML fragment includes (e.g., include: ./partials/slo_widgets.yaml).
üìä Dashboard Content & Metric Enhancements

Add a burn rate widget for faster SLO breach detection.
Add alert correlation widget using NrAiIncident to visualize policy activity.
Add Apdex/performance satisfaction widget to show end-user impact.
Add external service call latency widget to reveal upstream issues.
Add error class breakdown widget for faster debugging.
Use viz.heatmap or viz.histogram for latency distribution or duration analysis.
üõ† Tooling & UX Improvements

Implement layout validator to ensure no widget overlap or out-of-bounds layout.
Support output file naming with timestamp or dashboard name (--name or --timestamp flags).
Add --output-dir flag to write JSON into a user-defined folder.
Emit .md or .adoc dashboard summary file that mirrors the widget layout and queries.
Support multiple New Relic account IDs (per widget or per section).
üîÅ Code & Logic Optimization

Abstract legend and facet defaults based on visual.type, instead of explicitly setting them per widget.
Allow per-widget overrides for time windows, rather than a hardcoded SINCE value.
Support dynamic NRQL variables (e.g., ${appName} injected via CLI or env).
Let me know which ones you'd like to tackle first ‚Äî I can:

Scaffold templates,
Add Go logic for includes and anchors,
Expand the YAML schema,
Or deliver test dashboards to validate visualizations.
Let‚Äôs build a working queue!
